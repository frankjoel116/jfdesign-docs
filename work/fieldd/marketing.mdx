# Building Fieldd's Marketing From Scratch

<Field icon="seedling" />

Before I joined, Fieldd had no marketing team â€” just a powerful platform, a loyal customer base, and a product that sold itself (barely). My job was to take what was working behind the scenes and turn it into a story people understood.

## ðŸš§ The Starting Point

<warn>
  Fieldd had zero brand voice, no campaigns, and no consistent way to explain what it did. Marketing was a blank slate.
