# What is the MTE?

The MTE is a trade show designed to educate and elevate the mobile detailing industry...**our target demographic.**

I had the opportunity of attending the MTE 1 month into my employment at fieldd, and like most trade shows, most people would walk right past.

## Rethinking the entire playbook

1 year later and we were preparing for the MTE once again. I couldn't shake how distracted the event is, so I wanted to craft an experience unique to MTE attendees that would allow them to educate themselves without the need of a salesman. Here's the flow:

    B --> C[🕵️ Industry Vetting<br/>(Ask about visitor's industry)]
    C --> D{Match Industry?}

    D -->|Yes| E[🎯 Show Relevant Features<br/>Tailored by industry]
    D -->|No| F[📂 Show General Features]

    E --> G[✨ Feature 1 with CTA<br/>+ Driving Graphics]
    E --> H[🚀 Feature 2 with CTA<br/>+ Driving Graphics]
    E --> I[🔧 Feature 3 with CTA<br/>+ Driving Graphics]

    F --> J[✨ General Feature 1 with CTA]
    F --> K[🚀 General Feature 2 with CTA]

    G --> L[✅ High-Conversion Experience]
    H --> L
    I --> L
    J --> L
    K --> L
```

## The final product

An interactive experience that brings the modern experience of fieldd to the users hands immediately.
