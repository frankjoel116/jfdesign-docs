# What is the MTE?

The MTE is a trade show designed to educate and elevate the mobile detailing industry...**our target demographic.**

I had the opportunity of attending the MTE 1 month into my employment at fieldd, and like most trade shows, most people would walk right past.

## Rethinking the entire playbook

1 year later and we were preparing for the MTE once again. I couldn't shake how distracted the event is, so I wanted to craft an experience unique to MTE attendees that would allow them to educate themselves without the need of a salesman. Here's the flow:

    A[Attention Grabber: iPad at MTE booth] --> B{Visitor Approaches}
    B --> C[Industry Vetting]
    C --> D{Match Industry?}

    D -->|Yes| E[Show Relevant Features]
    D -->|No| F[Show General Features]

    E --> G[Feature 1 with CTA]
    E --> H[Feature 2 with CTA]
    E --> I[Feature 3 with CTA]

    F --> J[General Feature 1 with CTA]
    F --> K[General Feature 2 with CTA]

    G --> L[High-Conversion Experience]
    H --> L
    I --> L
    J --> L
    K --> L

```

## The final product

An interactive experience that brings the modern experience of fieldd to the users hands immediately.
