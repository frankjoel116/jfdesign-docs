# What is the MTE?

The MTE is a trade show designed to educate and elevate the mobile detailing industry...**our target demographic.**

I had the opportunity of attending the MTE 1 month into my employment at fieldd, and like most trade shows, most people would walk right past.

## Rethinking the entire playbook

1 year later and we were preparing for the MTE once again. I couldn't shake how distracted the event is, so I wanted to craft an experience unique to MTE attendees that would allow them to educate themselves without the need of a salesman. Here's the flow:
